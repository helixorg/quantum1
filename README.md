Quantum GEN 1
The Open World MMO game which works on the principles on real life and can show you what is your sheer potential.

Using Banking and Real World Tax rules and norms, we create a world seemingly simillar to the real life. In the game, one can gain skills, education, jobs and also open businesses if needed. Here, the population is entirely the cluster of human players around the world. Sophisticated Machine Learning is used to determine the future choises and measure intelligence level through your daily work cycle and not by some written tests. The time-scale is though, 7 times faster than that of the real world. Everything including bank clearks and big business owners and entrepreneurs will be real players who have used their financial knowledge to gain that status.

Players can also create services which have potential to be useful "IN GAME" and market it a.k.a sell it to other players in profit. For example, one can create a car business which can sell cars to have income. The buying and selling of things from "IN GAME COMPANIES" can affect the stock market value which gives the INVESTORS profits.

Everything will have worth in the game including the food you eat, the water you consume, the wife you choose (Which is also a REAL PLAYER), the occupation you choose, the quallifications, cars, houses, bonds, stocks, markets, businesses, etc.
